# Tom-N-Jerry-Returns
Tom N Jerry Returns a version 2.0 of original implementation this time on an Atmega32u4 microcontroller. 

# How to play: 
To play the game you will need a C compiler to compile the game into hex code. You can use cygwin with a GNU99 compiler or any other c compiler of your choice. Once compiled, you will need to flash the hex file onto the microcontroller. 

Please NOTE: 
- All the PWM pins of the Atmega32u4 microcontroller are used for screen output in this game. Schematic of the pin layout will be coming in a future commit.
